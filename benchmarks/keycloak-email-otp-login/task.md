    Two things make this harder than "turn on a setting". First, unlike magic-link,
    the magic-link extension does NOT auto-create any email-OTP flow, so one has to
    be authored - and the identifier step must run BEFORE ext-email-otp, which reads
    the attempted username off the auth session rather than collecting an address
    itself. Second, and much less obvious: WHICH authenticator collects the identifier
    decides whether the realm leaks account existence. Stock auth-username-form - the
    intuitive choice, and the one a related upstream test fixture actually uses -
    rejects an unknown address with "Invalid username or email" before ext-email-otp
    ever runs, so an attacker learns which addresses have accounts. Only an
    identifier-only step (ext-auth-username-auth-note) reaches ext-email-otp's own
    anti-enumeration-safe handling. A solution that logs a real user in successfully
    can still fail the actual requirement on that second point, which is why the
    unregistered-address case is tested rather than just the happy path.

Acme's support team is drowning in password resets. IT's answer:

> "Let staff sign in with a one-time code we email them, instead of a password."

A Keycloak identity server runs at `http://localhost:8080/auth`, serving a realm named `acme`.
It starts with the container and takes a few seconds to come up; `wait-for-services` blocks
until it answers. Admin REST API credentials are in `/root/admin_credentials.txt`.

Realm `acme` has one browser application registered, the public client `acme-portal`, whose
redirect URI is `http://localhost:9999/callback`. It has two staff accounts, both with a
verified email address on file:

- `priya` (`priya@acme-internal.example`)
- `morgan` (`morgan@acme-internal.example`)

Both currently have passwords, which is exactly what IT wants to stop relying on. There is no
real mail provider here - a local mail-capture server accepts whatever the realm sends and
writes each message to `/var/mail-capture/`; connection details are in
`/root/mail_server_details.txt`.

Configure the `acme` realm so that all of the following hold, for a browser
authorization-code login against `acme-portal`:

1. Someone entering `priya@acme-internal.example` is **never asked for a password** at any
   point. Instead a real email goes out through the realm's configured mail settings,
   containing a numeric one-time code.
2. Entering that code completes the login: the browser arrives back at
   `http://localhost:9999/callback` with an authorization code, and the `state` value the
   application sent is returned unchanged.
3. Someone entering an email address that belongs to **no** existing account gets the
   **same** response as a registered address - the login must not reveal which addresses have
   accounts. Behind that identical response, nothing observable may happen for the unregistered
   address: no mail may be sent for it, and no new account may be created.
4. Every other realm on the server is untouched, and no realm other than `master` and `acme`
   exists.
