    The request sounds like a plain access-control setting ("only these people can log
    in"), but Keycloak's authentication-flow editor has no such setting anywhere in it.
    The real mechanism - the p2-inc keycloak-orgs extension's `ext-select-org`
    authenticator - lives in a custom flow that has to be authored (via partial-import,
    not built by hand step by step) and bound as the realm's browser flow. The
    authenticator has to be told explicitly whether the application's account_hint will
    carry an organization's name or its ID (`match_by_org_name`), and the gate only
    actually activates when the login request itself carries `account_hint` (or
    `prompt=select_account`) - binding the flow with neither present looks like nothing
    happened at all. The obvious-looking verification (does a valid user with valid
    credentials get in?) also is not enough on its own: a flow that requires *some*
    account_hint value but never checks real membership passes that check while failing
    the actual requirement, so a genuine non-member has to be tested too.

Acme's security team has a new requirement:

> "Only engineering staff should be able to sign in to the internal tools portal."

A Keycloak identity server runs at `http://localhost:8080/auth`, serving a realm named `acme`. It starts with the container and takes a few seconds to come up; `wait-for-services` blocks until it answers. Admin REST API credentials are in `/root/admin_credentials.txt`.

Realm `acme` has one browser application registered, the public client `acme-portal`, whose redirect URI is `http://localhost:9999/callback`. It has two staff accounts, both already able to log in with a password:

- `priya` / `Priya!Pass1` — she is engineering staff and should be let in.
- `morgan` / `Morgan!Pass1` — he is not engineering staff and should be turned away.

Neither account belongs to any organization yet, and no organization exists yet.

The application will send a real login request to `acme-portal` carrying `account_hint=engineering` (the value it will use to mean "the engineering team") — it will not send `prompt=select_account`, and this is the only signal available to distinguish "let this person in" from "turn this person away."

Configure the `acme` realm so that all of the following hold, for a browser authorization-code login against `acme-portal` carrying `account_hint=engineering`:

1. `priya` completes the login and arrives back at `http://localhost:9999/callback` with an authorization code.
2. `morgan` does not complete the login — he must not receive an authorization code.
3. A login carrying an `account_hint` that matches no real organization at all does not complete for anyone, including `priya` — the gate must actually check membership in a real, specific organization, not merely require the presence of any `account_hint` value.
4. No realm other than `master` and `acme` exists, and no other users or realms were added.
