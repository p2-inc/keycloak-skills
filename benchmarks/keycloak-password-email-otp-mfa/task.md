    The request sounds like flipping on MFA, but Keycloak has no built-in
    "email me a code" second factor - its own OTP authenticators are TOTP/HOTP against
    an authenticator app, which is a different mechanism requiring device enrollment.
    The email-code authenticator comes from the p2-inc magic-link extension and ships
    with no flow of its own, so one has to be authored. The subtle part is that the
    same extension is normally used to REMOVE passwords, and the obvious flow shape
    borrowed from that use case (an identifier-only step, then the code) produces
    something that looks like it works - a real user logs in with a code - while
    silently making the password irrelevant: anyone who knows the email address gets
    a code. Getting this right means the password step must gate the code, which is
    only provable by checking that a WRONG password sends no email at all, not merely
    that a right one does.

Acme's security team has a new requirement for the internal tools portal:

> "Passwords stay, but they're not enough on their own any more. After the password, make
> people confirm a code we email them."

A Keycloak identity server runs at `http://localhost:8080/auth`, serving a realm named `acme`.
It starts with the container and takes a few seconds to come up; `wait-for-services` blocks
until it answers. Admin REST API credentials are in `/root/admin_credentials.txt`.

Realm `acme` has one browser application registered, the public client `acme-portal`, whose
redirect URI is `http://localhost:9999/callback`. It has two staff accounts, each with a
verified email address and a password already on file:

- `priya` (`priya@acme-internal.example`), password `Priya!Pass1`
- `morgan` (`morgan@acme-internal.example`), password `Morgan!Pass1`

There is no real mail provider here - a local mail-capture server accepts whatever the realm
sends and writes each message to `/var/mail-capture/`; connection details are in
`/root/mail_server_details.txt`.

Configure the `acme` realm so that all of the following hold, for a browser
authorization-code login against `acme-portal`:

1. `priya` signing in with her **correct** password is then asked for a one-time code, and a
   real email goes out through the realm's configured mail settings containing that code.
2. Entering the emailed code completes the login: the browser arrives back at
   `http://localhost:9999/callback` with an authorization code, and the `state` value the
   application sent is returned unchanged.
3. The password must genuinely gate the code, not merely precede it: an attempt using
   `priya`'s address with the **wrong** password must not produce any email at all. Knowing
   somebody's email address must not be enough to make the system send them a login code.
4. The password is still required - a login must not be completable using only the emailed
   code with no correct password.
5. Every other realm on the server is untouched, and no realm other than `master` and `acme`
   exists.
